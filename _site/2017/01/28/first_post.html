        <p>I am tired of analytics dictating my emotions and my thoughts, I am going to bring back the idea of the “weblog” at least for my own sanity on my side. I’ll explain <a href="https://macleodsawyer.com/log/i-am-tired-of-analytics">later</a>, too tired right now to really explain.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><em><strong>Edit:</strong> I have written that post <a href="https://macleodsawyer.com/log/i-am-tired-of-analytics">here</a></em></p>
