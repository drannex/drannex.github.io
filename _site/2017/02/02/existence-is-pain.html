        <p><span class="date">February 2, 2017</span> how are you today sir i made a blog that is finnnnne</p>
        <p>Our entire existence is fueled on the idea to survive, to survive means to get past pain and improve on ourselves.</p>

<p>We require pain to remind us of what the goal is. We have to survive to minimize pain.</p>

<p>We have lived this way all our life as a species. Without pain we would not survive. We would not look for new and better ways to live, we would not be innovative, and we would have died long ago. But we have survived where others have failed - simply because we have innovated as a society to survive.</p>

<p>To move forward as a society we have to go through tremendous pain, we have to find ways to rid ourselves of the pain around us. We have to be tortured through our current capitalistic economic system, we have to go through the pain that is the environment falling apart around us, and we have to go through societal tortures to find the way to end the torture and reach the end goal that we as a species have been after for all of our existence.</p>

<p>What is the point of it all? What is the goal we have been trying to reach? To build a painless existence.</p>

<p>The goal in life is to move forward, innovate, and create a world where we are less pained for existing.</p>

<p>That is the point of life, to end pain and stop living as we currently see it.</p>

<p>Without pain we can not move forward, without depression we can not be motivated to move forward, without a villain standing in front of us, we will never move forward.</p>

<p>Without pain, there is no innovation.</p>

<p>Without pain, we have no reason to fight.</p>

<p>What makes us alive is our will to fight to minimize the pain that surrounds us.</p>

<p>We fight for a selfish reason. We fight for what we believe will make our lives easier.  We fight to survive longer and easier. We fight to make our pain go away.</p>

<p>Some people believe we need to discriminate against others, or impede on others rights and way of life to be a better society to make our immediate selves have less pain.</p>

<p>Others believe, like I do, that we need to be focused on inclusion of the people around us. We need to not be judgemental of others, we need to stop discriminating against others to stop the cycle of discrimination. We believe in coming together and working towards our goal and purpose - to make life easier.</p>

<p>We have to be accepting to come together and make life easier together.</p>

<p>If we work to make life easier, to make life be less painful, then we can work together to end pain.</p>

<p>The easy way is to be focused on yourself and hope that you alone can find a way to stop the pain. This has never worked in the history of our society and has always been the end of all civilizations, when others take their own lives more seriously and their happiness more important than the people around them. They hope to be less pained by being exclusionary and independent without others meddling in their affairs.</p>

<p>The harder, more effective, and longer lasting way is by coming together and working together to reach a singular goal.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s what separates people, those who believe they can make their pain go away by being independent and selfish, and those that know that being inclusive leads to a life free of pain.</p>

<p>This is why organizations focused for social good created by the people have always been on the right side of history. This is why, when you look at history, the rights of people always prevail. The freedom of people always prevail. The acceptance of each other always prevail.</p>

<p>Existence is pain, and our goal in life is to find a way to work together to end pain.</p>

<p>Without pain we have no reason to fight. We have to have pain to show us the way to come together.</p>

<p>Existence is painful, and a necessary evil for good.</p>
