<p>My device kept bootlooping <strong>and would not</strong> allow me to read anything so I spent the last several days digging through forums, reddits, comment threads, and dozens of articles on repairing my frozen bootlooped Kindle Paperwhite.</p>

<p>After trying dozens of different “tips” I found a method by digging around the system directly that will force a system restore without any menu options or directly interacting with the Kindle.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you connect it to a computer you will be able view your files, <strong><em>I highly suggest you save all files in your kindle documents directory as this will delete everything on your Kindle.</em></strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect the Kindle to your computer (They suggest Windows or Mac OSX, but I completed this on Ubuntu 17.04 - just requires a file manager)</li>
  <li>Navigate to the <strong>root directory</strong> of the Kindle by accessing your systems file manager and selecting the Kindle device.</li>
  <li>Create a file titled <code class="highlighter-rouge">DO_FACTORY_RESTORE</code> without any file extensions attached to it.</li>
  <li>Now hold the power button for <strong>forty seconds</strong>. This will force a reboot.</li>
  <li>Wait.</li>
  <li>Wait..</li>
  <li>Wait…</li>
  <li>After it flashes a handful of times, the device will then take you to the “Language Selection” Wizard and you can set up your kindle just like it was brand new!</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have any other issues you can contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/MacleodSawyerMD">Twitter</a> or by contacting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/contact-us/general-questions.html?#">Amazon Support</a> (I suggest using the “Chat Support” feature).</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
