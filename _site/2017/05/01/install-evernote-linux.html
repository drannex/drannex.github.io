<p>I use Evernote a lot. It keeps all my thoughts, log journals, experiments, tests, code pieces (bash aliases, etc), personal simulation philisophy, thought pieces, articles, and more.</p>

<p>I also love to use Linux (Currently switching between Fedora &amp; Ubuntu Budgie, although using the Gnome desktop enviroment).</p>

<p>Sadly, evernote does not have a native linux application (doesn’t everyone just use nodejs and electron.js for desktop applications now?). In the past this has <em>eventually</em> led me to go back to Windows. But I have figured out a way, thanks to WineHQ, to get the latest Evernote version 6.4.2 to work on linux. It has some grapical issues, but mainly just text aliasing.</p>

<h2 id="heres-how-to-do-it-with-wine-and-winetricks-for-gui-haters">Here’s how to do it: with wine and winetricks (for GUI haters:</h2>

<p>Install winetricks with your package manager if it’s not already installed.
Run the following commands in a terminal:</p>
<ol>
  <li>export WINEARCH=win64</li>
  <li>winetricks -q ie8</li>
  <li>wine “<em>evernote_installer_path</em>”</li>
  <li>Follow the installer’s instructions</li>
  <li>The evernote executable is now located at “<em>wineprefix_path</em>/drive_c/Program  Files/Evernote/Evernote/Evernote.exe”</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="here-is-how-to-make-evernote-work-with-q4wine-a-gui-for-wine">Here is how to make Evernote work with q4wine, a gui for wine.</h2>

<p>Make sure you have winetricks and q4wine installed (look for them in your package manager).
Make sure that your terminal is properly configured in q4wine:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Opens the options menu: File &gt; Options</li>
  <li>Select “General” and opens the “Utils” tab</li>
  <li>Enter the path of your terminal, for instance “/usr/bin/gnome-terminal” if you use gnome.</li>
  <li>Enter “-e” as an argument (without the quotes, as always), so that q4wine can execute command just after opening a terminal.</li>
  <li>Download evernote for windows, from the evernote website.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Installation steps:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>In the terminal window, type “winetricks -q ie8” (without the quotes) and press Enter. Wait    for the ie8 installation to finish.</li>
  <li>Run the Evernote installer.</li>
</ol>

<p>You now have Evernote working (nearly perfectly).</p>

<p>WebClipper also works which was a massive surprise. Applicator and all.</p>
